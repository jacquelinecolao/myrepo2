# Installation 

Make sure you have installed Markdown and Tinetex before getting started. See [link](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/installation.html) for details.

# Introduction

This is a paragraph in an R Markdown document.

Below is a code chunk:


## Figure
```{r, fig.cap="A Simple Regression", out.width='55%', fig.align='center'}
fit = lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
b   = coef(fit)
plot(cars)
abline(fit)
```


The slope of the regression is `r b[2]`.


## Formula
$$\begin{array}{ccc}
x_{11} & x_{12} & x_{13}\\
x_{21} & x_{22} & x_{23}
\end{array}$$


## Table
```{r tables-mtcars}
knitr::kable(iris[1:5, ], caption = 'A caption')
```
